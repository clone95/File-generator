# File-generator
A faster way to generate new multiple files from command line

Having the need of re-organize university notes, i wrote a simple script to automate some parts of the creation of files.
In this way i just have to type the namen and press enter, instead of:

                                                                          - right click
                                                                          - new
                                                                          - file extension
                                                                          - type the name
                                                                          - press enter

so, for example if i have to generate  50 different files, i justa have 50*2 = 100 steps, instead of 50 * 5 250 steps
